## EBOX

I'm a believer of Inbox Zero methodology & productivity tool minimalism. Most note taking / to-do list apps I've encountered nowadays have too many bells & whistles. I wanted something simple and lightweight - so I built this.

Inbox Zero requires that you move inbound emails to a central to-do list, and immediately archive the email. So this app integrates with Gmail. While clearing out your inbox, you can apply the (automatically-generated) gmail label "ebox." After zeroing out your inbox, you can return to the app & pull in all the labeled emails into your list.

...and just because I like having a simple (and teamporary) note pad while looking at my todo list, I added a textarea to the page.
